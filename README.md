Rusty Store: Inventory Manager
This is a simple command-line app I built in Rust to help small shops keep track of their stuff. It’s all text-based, so it’s super easy for anyone to use.

What it does:

	•	Manage Products: Add, edit, delete, and see all your products.
	•	Track Sales & Purchases: Log when you sell or buy items, and the inventory updates automatically. It also keeps track of your sales and costs.
	•	Simple Reports: Get quick reports on your current stock, sales, and purchase history.
	•	Basic Login: A simple username and password to keep things secure.

Built with:

	•	Language: Rust
	•	Data: `Vec` and `HashMap` for storing items, and JSON files to save the data.

How to get it running:

	1.	Clone the project:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/rusty-store.git`
	2.	Build and run it:
`cargo build`
`cargo run`

What I’d like to add next:

	•	Different user roles, like a manager and a cashier.
	•	Adding discounts and taxes.
	•	Maybe move from JSON to a simple database.
